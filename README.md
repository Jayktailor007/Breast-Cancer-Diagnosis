In medical field, classification and data mining methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions.Now we use one of the Machine Learning algorithms,i.e Naive Bayes Classifier which is widely applied in cancer research for development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making.
